# The AU8 Benchmark Dataset

This is the code repository for our paper submitted to ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025, ‚ÄúAU8: A Multimodal Benchmark Dataset from Eight Australian Cities for Sustainable Urban Development‚Äù. AU8 comprises eight major Australian cities including Greater Sydney, Greater Melbourne, Greater Brisbane, Greater Perth, Greater Adelaide, Greater Canberra, Greater Darwin, and Greater Hobart and contains 101,604 satellite image tiles, each paired with a declarative textual description and nine key urban indicators (e.g., population density, median income, housing price, land use). We release the full dataset on Hugging Face at https://huggingface.co/datasets/CRUISEResearchGroup/AU8.


In AU8 we also provide comprehensive metadata for all Images, which are listed below.

# üõ∞Ô∏è Experiments


## üîß Setup

Before running, make sure you have installed all required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üîß UrbanCLIP

This directory provides instructions for running experiments using UrbanCLIP, including both pretraining (or finetuning) and downstream prediction tasks.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Pretrain / Finetune UrbanCLIP

Train UrbanCLIP on satellite-caption data using:

```bash
python main.py \
  --dataset Adelaide_captions \
  --epoch_num 100 \
  --batch_size 2 \
  --pretrained_model laion-mscoco_finetuned_CoCa-ViT-L-14-laion2B-s13B-b90k/open_clip_pytorch_model.bin
```

üìù The best model will be saved to:

```
checkpoints/best_model.bin
```

Logs will be stored in:

```
logs/{seed}.log
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Downstream Tasks

You can now use the pretrained `best_model.bin` to extract image features and predict various urban indicators.

#### a. XGBoost Regression

Use image features from the pretrained UrbanCLIP model and train an XGBoost regressor:

```bash
python xgboost.py \
  --dataset Adelaide \
  --indicator Median_price_of_established_house_transfers__2023_log \
  --pretrained_model ./checkpoints/best_model.bin
```

**Output:**

- Predictions: `data/downstream_task/Adelaide_urbxg/Adelaide_test_predicted.csv`
- Evaluation metrics: `data/downstream_task/Adelaide_evaluation_metrics.csv`

---

#### b. MLP Linear Probe

Train an MLP on top of frozen UrbanCLIP features:

```bash
python mlp.py \
  --dataset Adelaide \
  --indicator Median_price_of_established_house_transfers__2023_log \
  --pretrained_model ./checkpoints/best_model.bin
```

**Output:**

- Predictions: `data/downstream_task/Adelaide_test_predicted.csv`
- Logs: `logs/downtask1/132.log`

---


### üìå Notes

- You must run `main.py` first to generate the pretrained model used in downstream tasks.
- Set `--indicator` to the desired urban indicator for prediction (e.g., `Median_price_of_established_house_transfers__2023_log`).
- Make sure your dataset files (e.g., `Adelaide_train.csv`, `Adelaide_test.csv`) are placed in `data/downstream_task/`.
