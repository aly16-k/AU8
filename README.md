# The AU8 Benchmark Dataset

This is the code repository for our paper submitted to ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025, “AU8: A Multimodal Benchmark Dataset from Eight Australian Cities for Sustainable Urban Development”. AU8 comprises eight major Australian cities including Greater Sydney, Greater Melbourne, Greater Brisbane, Greater Perth, Greater Adelaide, Greater Canberra, Greater Darwin, and Greater Hobart and contains 101,604 satellite image tiles, each paired with a declarative textual description and nine key urban indicators (e.g., population density, median income, housing price, land use). We release the full dataset on Hugging Face at https://huggingface.co/datasets/CRUISEResearchGroup/AU8.


In AU8 we also provide comprehensive metadata for all Images, which are listed below.
